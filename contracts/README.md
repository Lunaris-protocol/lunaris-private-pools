## 🔐 Hybrid System Architecture

### What It Does

The Hybrid System integrates two privacy technologies:

1. **Privacy Pools**: Commitment-based privacy using ZK-SNARKs for deposit/withdrawal privacy
2. **Encrypted ERC**: Encrypted balance tokens using ElGamal encryption for transfer privacy

### User Experience

**Standard Flow**: `Deposit ERC20 → Privacy Pool → Withdraw ERC20`

**Hybrid Flow**:

1. `Deposit ERC20 → Privacy Pool + Encrypted ERC Mint`
2. `Private Transfers with Encrypted ERC (optional)`
3. `Withdraw (Burn Encrypted + Pool Withdrawal) → Receive ERC20`

### Benefits

- **Dual Privacy**: Users get both mixing privacy AND encrypted balance privacy
- **Backward Compatible**: Standard Privacy Pool functionality unchanged
- **Flexible**: Users can choose hybrid or standard flows
- **Composable**: Can be integrated with existing DeFi protocols

## 🧩 Core Contracts

### HybridOrchestrator.sol

**Purpose**: Central coordinator between both privacy systems

**Key Functions**:

- `onDeposit()`: Called when users deposit, triggers encrypted token minting
- `onWithdraw()`: Called before withdrawals, coordinates encrypted token burning
- `setPoolAuthorization()`: Manage authorized privacy pools
- `setAssetTokenId()`: Map assets to encrypted token IDs

**Security**: Must be highly secured as it has privileged access to both systems

### PrivacyPoolHybrid.sol

**Purpose**: Extended Privacy Pool with hybrid functionality

**Key Functions**:

- `deposit()`: Standard deposit + orchestrator notification (automatic)
- `withdrawWithBurn()`: New withdrawal method that burns encrypted tokens first
- `withdraw()`: Standard withdrawal (disabled when hybrid mode active)
- `setHybridEnabled()`: Toggle hybrid functionality

**Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing Privacy Pool interfaces

### EncryptedERCHybrid.sol

**Purpose**: Extended Encrypted ERC with orchestrator privileges

**Key Functions**:

- `orchestratorMint()`: Privileged minting for deposits (called by orchestrator)
- `orchestratorBurn()`: Coordinated burning for withdrawals
- All standard Encrypted ERC functions (privateMint, privateBurn, transfer, etc.)

**Security**: Orchestrator privileges are carefully controlled and can be disabled

## 🔄 Integration Flows

### Deposit Flow

```
1. User calls Entrypoint.deposit(asset, amount, precommitment)
2. Entrypoint → PrivacyPoolHybrid.deposit()
3. PrivacyPoolHybrid creates commitment (standard Privacy Pool logic)
4. PrivacyPoolHybrid → HybridOrchestrator.onDeposit()
5. HybridOrchestrator → EncryptedERCHybrid.orchestratorMint()
6. User now has:
   ✅ Commitment in Privacy Pool
   ✅ Encrypted ERC balance equivalent
```

### Withdrawal Flow

```
1. User prepares two ZK proofs:
   - Privacy Pool withdrawal proof
   - Encrypted ERC burn proof
2. User calls PrivacyPoolHybrid.withdrawWithBurn(withdrawal, poolProof, burnProof)
3. PrivacyPoolHybrid validates pool withdrawal proof
4. PrivacyPoolHybrid → HybridOrchestrator.onWithdraw()
5. HybridOrchestrator → EncryptedERCHybrid.orchestratorBurn()
6. If burn successful → Privacy Pool withdrawal proceeds
7. User receives original ERC20 tokens
```

## ⚡ Gas Costs & Performance

| Operation | Standard | Hybrid | Additional Cost |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Deposit   | ~150k    | ~350k  | +200k (+133%)   |
| Withdraw  | ~300k    | ~700k  | +400k (+133%)   |
| Transfer  | N/A      | ~150k  | New capability  |

**Cost Breakdown**:

- Orchestrator coordination: ~50k gas
- Encrypted token minting/burning: ~150k gas
- Additional storage operations: ~50k gas

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Trust Assumptions

1. **HybridOrchestrator**: Trusted coordinator with privileged access
2. **ZK Verifiers**: Trusted circuits for proof validation
3. **Privacy Pool Entrypoint**: Trusted entry point (unchanged)
4. **Encrypted ERC Registrar**: Trusted user registration (unchanged)

### Security Guarantees

1. **Balance Consistency**: Orchestrator ensures encrypted balances match pool commitments
2. **Atomic Operations**: Withdrawals are atomic - burn must succeed for withdrawal
3. **Proof Validity**: All ZK proofs must be valid for operations to proceed
4. **Authorization**: Only authorized pools can interact with orchestrator

### Attack Vectors & Mitigations

1. **Orchestrator Compromise**:
   - Mitigation: Multi-signature ownership, emergency pause
2. **State Desynchronization**:
   - Mitigation: Atomic operations, comprehensive validation
3. **Invalid Proofs**:
   - Mitigation: Dual verification, circuit audits
4. **Gas Griefing**:
   - Mitigation: Gas limits, efficient implementations

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests**: Each contract tested individually

```bash
forge test --match-contract HybridOrchestrator
forge test --match-contract PrivacyPoolHybrid
forge test --match-contract EncryptedERCHybrid
```

**Integration Tests**: Full system flows

```bash
forge test --match-contract HybridSystemTests
```

**Security Tests**: Attack scenarios

```bash
forge test --match-test testUnauthorized
forge test --match-test testSecurityBreach
```

### Key Test Scenarios

- ✅ End-to-end deposit with encrypted minting
- ✅ End-to-end withdrawal with coordinated burning
- ✅ Multi-user scenarios with different assets
- ✅ Security edge cases and attack prevention
- ✅ Gas optimization verification
- ✅ Backward compatibility validation
