## üîê Hybrid System Architecture

### What It Does

The Hybrid System integrates two privacy technologies:

1. **Privacy Pools**: Commitment-based privacy using ZK-SNARKs for deposit/withdrawal privacy
2. **Encrypted ERC**: Encrypted balance tokens using ElGamal encryption for transfer privacy

### User Experience

**Standard Flow**: `Deposit ERC20 ‚Üí Privacy Pool ‚Üí Withdraw ERC20`

**Hybrid Flow**:

1. `Deposit ERC20 ‚Üí Privacy Pool + Encrypted ERC Mint`
2. `Private Transfers with Encrypted ERC (optional)`
3. `Withdraw (Burn Encrypted + Pool Withdrawal) ‚Üí Receive ERC20`

### Benefits

- **Dual Privacy**: Users get both mixing privacy AND encrypted balance privacy
- **Backward Compatible**: Standard Privacy Pool functionality unchanged
- **Flexible**: Users can choose hybrid or standard flows
- **Composable**: Can be integrated with existing DeFi protocols

## üß© Core Contracts

### HybridOrchestrator.sol

**Purpose**: Central coordinator between both privacy systems

**Key Functions**:

- `onDeposit()`: Called when users deposit, triggers encrypted token minting
- `onWithdraw()`: Called before withdrawals, coordinates encrypted token burning
- `setPoolAuthorization()`: Manage authorized privacy pools
- `setAssetTokenId()`: Map assets to encrypted token IDs

**Security**: Must be highly secured as it has privileged access to both systems

### PrivacyPoolHybrid.sol

**Purpose**: Extended Privacy Pool with hybrid functionality

**Key Functions**:

- `deposit()`: Standard deposit + orchestrator notification (automatic)
- `withdrawWithBurn()`: New withdrawal method that burns encrypted tokens first
- `withdraw()`: Standard withdrawal (disabled when hybrid mode active)
- `setHybridEnabled()`: Toggle hybrid functionality

**Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing Privacy Pool interfaces

### EncryptedERCHybrid.sol

**Purpose**: Extended Encrypted ERC with orchestrator privileges

**Key Functions**:

- `orchestratorMint()`: Privileged minting for deposits (called by orchestrator)
- `orchestratorBurn()`: Coordinated burning for withdrawals
- All standard Encrypted ERC functions (privateMint, privateBurn, transfer, etc.)

**Security**: Orchestrator privileges are carefully controlled and can be disabled

## üîÑ Integration Flows

### Deposit Flow

```
1. User calls Entrypoint.deposit(asset, amount, precommitment)
2. Entrypoint ‚Üí PrivacyPoolHybrid.deposit()
3. PrivacyPoolHybrid creates commitment (standard Privacy Pool logic)
4. PrivacyPoolHybrid ‚Üí HybridOrchestrator.onDeposit()
5. HybridOrchestrator ‚Üí EncryptedERCHybrid.orchestratorMint()
6. User now has:
   ‚úÖ Commitment in Privacy Pool
   ‚úÖ Encrypted ERC balance equivalent
```

### Withdrawal Flow

```
1. User prepares two ZK proofs:
   - Privacy Pool withdrawal proof
   - Encrypted ERC burn proof
2. User calls PrivacyPoolHybrid.withdrawWithBurn(withdrawal, poolProof, burnProof)
3. PrivacyPoolHybrid validates pool withdrawal proof
4. PrivacyPoolHybrid ‚Üí HybridOrchestrator.onWithdraw()
5. HybridOrchestrator ‚Üí EncryptedERCHybrid.orchestratorBurn()
6. If burn successful ‚Üí Privacy Pool withdrawal proceeds
7. User receives original ERC20 tokens
```

## ‚ö° Gas Costs & Performance

| Operation | Standard | Hybrid | Additional Cost |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Deposit   | ~150k    | ~350k  | +200k (+133%)   |
| Withdraw  | ~300k    | ~700k  | +400k (+133%)   |
| Transfer  | N/A      | ~150k  | New capability  |

**Cost Breakdown**:

- Orchestrator coordination: ~50k gas
- Encrypted token minting/burning: ~150k gas
- Additional storage operations: ~50k gas

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

### Trust Assumptions

1. **HybridOrchestrator**: Trusted coordinator with privileged access
2. **ZK Verifiers**: Trusted circuits for proof validation
3. **Privacy Pool Entrypoint**: Trusted entry point (unchanged)
4. **Encrypted ERC Registrar**: Trusted user registration (unchanged)

### Security Guarantees

1. **Balance Consistency**: Orchestrator ensures encrypted balances match pool commitments
2. **Atomic Operations**: Withdrawals are atomic - burn must succeed for withdrawal
3. **Proof Validity**: All ZK proofs must be valid for operations to proceed
4. **Authorization**: Only authorized pools can interact with orchestrator

### Attack Vectors & Mitigations

1. **Orchestrator Compromise**:
   - Mitigation: Multi-signature ownership, emergency pause
2. **State Desynchronization**:
   - Mitigation: Atomic operations, comprehensive validation
3. **Invalid Proofs**:
   - Mitigation: Dual verification, circuit audits
4. **Gas Griefing**:
   - Mitigation: Gas limits, efficient implementations

## üß™ Testing

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests**: Each contract tested individually

```bash
forge test --match-contract HybridOrchestrator
forge test --match-contract PrivacyPoolHybrid
forge test --match-contract EncryptedERCHybrid
```

**Integration Tests**: Full system flows

```bash
forge test --match-contract HybridSystemTests
```

**Security Tests**: Attack scenarios

```bash
forge test --match-test testUnauthorized
forge test --match-test testSecurityBreach
```

### Key Test Scenarios
